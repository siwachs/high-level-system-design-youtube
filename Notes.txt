1) Play video on Client (Any URL using S3)

2) Upload Service -> Upload on S3 and test using Postman

3) Send Upload Request from Client to server with file

Usage of Kafka
In this Upload service act as Producer and transcoder act as Consumer

Onr cloud base solution for Kafka is
https://aiven.io

On uploading we need to do:
1) Content Filtering like check for explicit content in videos
2) Copyright issues
3) Transcoding (Transform in different format)

Solution: PubSub

Video ---> Goes to PubSun ie Kafka ---> And now different services can pick same message and use it ie consume message and use it.
For example transcoder consume this message and use it.

Or in Short Push a message to PubSun and that message should be consume by other service such as transcoder.
